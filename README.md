# tipperbuddy
Tipper Buddy is a user-friendly tipping calculator that allows users to customize their tip based on their experience.
This is built using HTML and JavaScript. I avoided the temptation of dragging in JQuery and instead used SASS to build some nice stylesheets to style an input box, cool sliders (for experience/range inputs) and some nice shiiny buttons!
The JavaScript spits out the "standard" tip of 20%, but if the user wants to dig deeper and "customize" their tip, they have the option of adding some modifications based on factors like the friendliness of the server, the overall experience, and so on. 
Given more time (later editions?) I would style the "recommendations" section a bit differently. I resisted the urge to add more modification factors, because from a UX standpoint, few people want to spend a bunch of time figuring out exactly how much to tip. I settled on 3 factors plus an overall experience score (which is weighted 2x).
Play with the sliders, and be sure to notice the "personalized" messages in the recommendation section based on the percentage of your recommended tip.
